Great job! Your alghhoritm is  a correct implementation of a SELF-ADAPTIVE alghhoritm for the setcover problem.
Your project could benefit from better documentation , for example by adding some comments that explain what you are doing.
A possible improvements is to avoid always doing 10000 steps, on smaller universe size you get same solution with a lot less steps, an idea is to change max number of step based on the universe size , smaller universes less steps , bigger ones more steps.
